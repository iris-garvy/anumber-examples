# anumber-examples
Generates Artin-Schreier curves with minimal a-number with ramification invariant congruent to -1 (mod p)
To generate examples run "minimal_polynomial_examples.m" in the MAGMA computational algebra system and it will load all the functions.
Run the function sample_minimal(d,p) to check 100 random polynomials with degree d over F_p and return how many have minimal a-number.
Run the function print_examples() to start writing to a file called "listofpolynomials.txt".
The "listofpolynomials.txt" file here is a pre-run example list.
